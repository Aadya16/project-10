    <p>Space exploration has always
        captivated human imagination.
        It's a journey to the unknown!</p>

    <p>From the Moon to distant galaxies,
        we continue to explore the
        vastness of space.</p>

    <p>The Space Explorers Club, launching Monday (April 5), offers a full year of virtual engagements with men and
        women who
        made history in space. From an Apollo astronaut who test flew the space shuttle to a record holder for the most
        flights
        into space, the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation's Space Explorers Club promises its members an unforgettable
        series of
        online encounters.

        "Take your space enthusiasm to the limit," the ASF wrote on its website. "Engage in a virtual space with some of
        the
        legendary leaders in the aerospace."</p>

    <p>The same type of interactions will be available with each of the club's presenters, including seven-time flier
        and
        spacewalker Jerry Ross in June and space shuttle mission specialist Mike Mullane in July. Other astronauts
        scheduled for
        the club's first year include space shuttle Discovery's first pilot Michael Coats; Eileen Collins, the first
        woman to
        command a shuttle mission; and Sandy Magnus, who flew on the final shuttle mission.</p>
